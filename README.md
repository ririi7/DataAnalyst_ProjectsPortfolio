# Ricka Johan - Junior Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Ricka. I've recently completed my bootcamp masters program in Data Analytics, and am currently working towards my Professional Certificate in Data Analytics. My background is from Business Improvement & Quality Assurance, Recruitment & working with Human Resource Information Systems. Entering into the Data Analytics field has been a long-term desire, to enact my problem-solving and reporting skills. Thankfully, after the pandemic lockdowns I was finally able to resume my learning. I enjoy data wrangling, and exploring meaningful insights. My long-term goal is to specialise in the Big Data realm. Here, I share my Data Analytics and Data Science related projects to showcase my skills and track my progress in this field. 

# Projects

## 1. Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis and K-Means Modelling
#### Project by KPMG, Forage's Virtual Internship [certificate of completion](https://github.com/ririi7/DataAnalyst_ProjectsPortfolio/blob/main/KPMG%20AU_9uBbwoovpYXJDNtNs_1673847610052_completion_certificate.pdf)

Domain: Retail & Marketing

Description: Merge and analyse multiple customers' demographic, geogrpahical and behavioural data to identify the best customers to target for a new marketing campaign. The project required a lengthy amount of data wrangling, from imputing missing values, reformatting datatypes and values, renaming and recalculating fields, and utilised Recency Frequency and Monetary Analysis with K-Means modelling to segment the customers, and identify the most highest value customers. Additionally, I also created an in-depth email for the client to explain how to mitigate the Data Quality issues present in their datasets, and prepared a powerpoint presentation to explain the steps involved in analysing their data.

Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Python Libraries, Tableau, PowerPoint
