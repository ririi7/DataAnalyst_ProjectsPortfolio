# Projects

## 1. KPMG Sprocket Central - Customer Segmentation Analysis 
#### (by Forage Virtual Internship)

Domain: Retail & Marketing

Description: Merge and analyse multiple customers' demographic, geogrpahical and behavioural data to conclude the best customers to target for a new marketing campaign. The project required a lengthy amount of data wrangling, from imputing missing values, reformatting datatypes and values, renaming and recalculating fields, and utilised Recency Frequency and Montary Analysis with K-Means modelling to segment the customers, and identify the most highest value customers. Additionally, I also created an in-depth email for the client to explain how to mitigate the Data Quality issues present in their datasets, and prepared a powerpoint presentation to explain the steps involved in analysing their data.

Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Python Libraries, Tableau, PowerPoint
